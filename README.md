# gadget-hello-world
A "Hello World" contextual gmail gadget based on https://developers.google.com/gmail/contextual_gadgets

Hosted on github pages at: http://sbrudz.github.io/gadget-hello-world/

**NOTE:** The steps below do not result in a fully working gadget.  It shows up as being installed but no card is displayed when an email with "Hello World" is received.  A PR to fix this issue would be welcome.  In the meantime, I recommend writing a Google Chrome or a Firefox extension instead.

## Steps to Publish

Here are the steps I followed to get this published to the Google Apps Marketplace (as of November 24, 2015):

1. Select the "Google Apps Marketplace SDK" under "Google Apps APIs"
1. On the "Google Apps Marketplace SDK" page:
   1. Click the "Enable API" button
   1. Click the "Configuration" tab
   1. Click the "Create an OAuth 2.0 client ID" link, which will take you to the Credentials page
1. On the Credentials page:
   1. Click the "Add credentials" link and choose the "OAuth 2.0 Client ID" option
   1. Click the "Configure Consent Screen" button
   1. Fill out the required information and click "Save".
   1. Under "Create client ID", do the following (per [these instructions](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/javascript/start/start-js)):
      1. Choose Application type = Web application

      1. Enter your website root in "Authorized JavaScript origins"

   1. Enter configuration info as follows:
      1. Add a description
      1. Add 4 icons of various sizes
      1. Add a URL for the Terms of Service.  I used: http://sbrudz.github.io/gadget-hello-world/tos.html
   1. In the extensions section, check the "Universal navigation extension" and enter a URL.  I used: https://github.com/sbrudz/gadget-hello-world
   1. Then check the "Gmail contextual gadget extension" with:
      1. **Extractor URL:** google.com:HelloWorld
      1. **Gadget URL:** http://sbrudz.github.io/gadget-hello-world/hello_world_gadget.xml
